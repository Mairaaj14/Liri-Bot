# Welcome

### Overview
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, just like Iphone's SIRI. However, LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back some data. You cNan tell Liri to look up a song for you, you can ask for the info on a movie, and you can also find out about concerts about a certain band/artist.
